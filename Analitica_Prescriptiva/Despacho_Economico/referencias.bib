ABSTRACT = {Economic Dispatch Problems (EDP) refer to the process of determining the power output of generation units such that the electricity demand of the system is satisfied at a minimum cost while technical and operational constraints of the system are satisfied. This procedure is vital in the efficient energy management of electricity networks since it can ensure the reliable and efficient operation of power systems. As power systems transition from conventional to modern ones, new components and constraints are introduced to power systems, making the EDP increasingly complex. This highlights the importance of developing advanced optimization techniques that can efficiently handle these new complexities to ensure optimal operation and cost-effectiveness of power systems. This review paper provides a comprehensive exploration of the EDP, encompassing its mathematical formulation and the examination of commonly used problem formulation techniques, including single and multi-objective optimization methods. It also explores the progression of paradigms in economic dispatch, tracing the journey from traditional methods to contemporary strategies in power system management. The paper categorizes the commonly utilized techniques for solving EDP into four groups: conventional mathematical approaches, uncertainty modelling methods, artificial intelligence-driven techniques, and hybrid algorithms. It identifies critical research gaps, a predominant focus on single-case studies that limit the generalizability of findings, and the challenge of comparing research due to arbitrary system choices and formulation variations. The present paper calls for the implementation of standardized evaluation criteria and the inclusion of a diverse range of case studies to enhance the practicality of optimization techniques in the field.},

ABSTRACT = {Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) is a key issue in power systems and its goal is to achieve minimum economic costs by allocating the output of generator units when satisfying the load demands and the operating constraints. As the dimension of the variables and the constraints increase, the traditional mathematical method is gradually not suitable for the ELD. This paper proposes an Improved Bird Swarm Algorithm (IBSA) to solve the ELD problem of a power system. By introducing the nonlinear cognitive and social coefficients, the proportion of individual learning and social learning of birds can be dynamically adjusted. In addition, the Levy flight strategy is added to the group between producers and beggars to increase the randomness. The performance of IBSA is verified via two systems consisting of 6 and 15 units, respectively, that take into account generation limitation, ramp rate limit, and prohibited operating zones. From the simulation results, the IBSA has shown excellent performance and robustness, which can be considered as a reliable solution for the ELD.},
